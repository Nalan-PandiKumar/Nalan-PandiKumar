## Points to Note to Become a Real Hacker and Achieve Big Things in Hacking

As a passionate _**low-level programmer**_, I admire these principles and strive to follow them on my journey to mastering the art of hacking.

🔹 **"Everything is open source if you can read _**assembly**_."**

💻 **"A real hacker doesn't need the abstractions provided by _**high-level programming languages**_."**

🛠️ **"True mastery lies in understanding what happens _**under the hood**_, not just what’s visible on the surface."**

🔧 **"Learning a _**high-level language**_ shows you how to use tools. Learning _**C**_ teaches you how to _**build**_ them."**

🔍 **"Abstractions make programming easier, but they hide the most _**interesting details**_. Real hackers _**dig deeper**_."**

🧠 **"A hacker's mind is built to _**question**_ what’s hidden beneath—whether it’s _**code**_, _**hardware**_, or _**abstraction**_."**

⚙️ **"In _**low-level programming**_, nothing is hidden from you. You control every _**byte**_, every _**instruction**_, and every flow of execution."**

🚀 **"Master the _**foundations**_, and no _**abstraction**_ can limit what you can do."**
